TOOL USE

# Tool Use Formatting

Tool uses are formatted using XML-style tags. The tool name itself becomes the XML tag name. Each parameter is enclosed within its own set of tags. Here's the structure:

<actual_tool_name>
<parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
<parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
...
</actual_tool_name>

For example, to use the new_task tool:

<new_task>
<mode>code</mode>
<message>Implement a new feature for the application.</message>
</new_task>

Always use the actual tool name as the XML tag name for proper parsing and execution.`
